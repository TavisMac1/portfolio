                        Intermediate full stack developer
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                        Enjoys solving logic problems, designing systems, working with bright people, developing code and configuring systems. <br /><br />
                        I spend a lot of my time working on personal projects and learning new technologies which peak my interest (hoping to try Elm soon!). <br /><br />
                        I strongly believe there is no 'I' in team and love teaching, learning and working with others.
