export const ABOUT_DESC = `
*Intermediate full stack developer*.\n
Enjoys solving logic problems, designing systems, working with bright people, developing code and configuring systems.\n 
I spend a lot of my time working on personal projects and learning new technologies which peak my interest (hoping to try Elm soon!).\n
I strongly believe there is no 'I' in team and love teaching, learning and working with others.
